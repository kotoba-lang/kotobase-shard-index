# kotobase-shard-index

**A search index that a client reads directly out of an object store.** No
query server, no database to hydrate, no cache tier. One immutable object per
content address; the client descends a tree and stops as soon as the answer is
proven.

The design, the measurements and the limits are recorded in
`com-junkawasaki/root`: **ADR-2608071500** (the read path and why the hydrate
path could not get there), **ADR-2608085000** (removing the client-side
fan-out, and what a client may write back), **ADR-2608086000** (appending
without rebuilding, and the first measurement on a real corpus).

## Addresses are multiformats CIDv1

A block's address is `CIDv1 / raw / sha2-256 / base32-lower` — the same form
`GET /ipld/<cid>` on the kotobase storage plane serves, and the same form
`kotobase.blocks/verify-block` checks. Header `01 55 12 20`.

It used to be `b<hex>`, this subsystem's own form, with adopting multiformats
recorded as a named follow-up rather than quietly assumed. This is that
follow-up. The digest was always sha-256 of the canonical bytes, so the change
re-encodes an address that was already the right number — and it is what lets
these blocks *be* ordinary blocks in the storage plane rather than a private
namespace beside it.

It is a format change: every address moves, so an index built before this must
be rebuilt rather than read. Nothing published had been.

Everything here is portable `.cljc` with **zero dependencies** — that is what
lets the read half run in a browser against a bucket, which is the whole point.

## Why it is not the deployed path

kotobase.net answers a query in ~2.5s, and **92% of that is hydration** —
rebuilding a database value before the query starts (ADR-2607310900 訂正3).
The sequential part of hydration is walking the unfolded novelty cons-chain,
**97% of the round trips** at the fold threshold (ADR-2608021000). Both are
properties of "materialise the database, then query it", and neither exists
here: nothing is materialised, and a client only ever reads published blocks.

The cost model changes with it. `arrangement`'s measured hydrate is linear in
the size of the *database* — 57ms/50 block-reads at 2k facts, 678ms/640 at 32k,
however few rows come back. Here a query's GET count tracks the *answer*.

## Shape

```
manifest  (one CID -- the only mutable pointer in the system)
 └── shard[i]
      ├── dict-root ──> dict-internal ──> dict-leaf      term -> posting head
      │                                    (fanout B, height = log_B(terms))
      ├── posting-head ──> posting-chunk...              impact-ordered
      └── meta-dir     ──> meta-chunk...                 url/title for display
```

Every block is addressed by the sha-256 of its canonical bytes, so a block that
differs is a different key. That is what makes `Cache-Control: immutable`
correct without an invalidation path, and what lets an untrusted store be
verified by the reader (`block/verify-block`).

## Why one manifest, and not one ref per shard

The workspace rule that a query plane reaches exactly one ref
(ADR-260726) is about **atomicity**: two refs advance independently, so a
query spanning both has no single basis and can return a state that never
existed. It is not a limit on how much data one ref addresses.

So the shards live *under* one manifest. Readers get one consistent snapshot
(one manifest CID pins every shard); writers get parallelism, because shard
segments are built independently and only the manifest commit is serialised.
The usual "query reach versus write parallelism" trade-off does not apply,
because the thing being serialised is a pointer swap per publish rather than a
head CAS per write.

## Exactness

Postings are impact-ordered, so a document missing from the prefix of a term's
list cannot score above that term's next unread chunk. Every candidate
therefore has a lower bound (what has been summed) and an upper bound (plus
its unseen terms' thresholds); an unseen document has the shard's threshold
sum. The scan stops when those separate.

**Exact by score.** The k scores returned are the k largest, and each is the
document's complete score. **Ties are unspecified** — which of several
equal-scoring documents is returned, and in what order, is not determined. The
bound reasons about scores and cannot see the doc-id tie-break; forcing it to
would mean reading every chunk whose max-impact equals the k-th score.

This limit is stated because the first version of this code silently claimed
more, and `test/run_tests.cljs` caught it by checking the bounded scan against
a full scan of the same index.

That test is the reason to believe the rest — but only after it was made
capable of failing. Mutation testing showed the original version passed with
the bound understated 4x and with the unseen-document term removed entirely:
the corpora were small enough that one prefetch wave consumed every posting
list, so every query ended `:exhausted` and the bound was never consulted. The
suite now includes configurations where stopping early is a real decision, and
asserts that `:proof :bounded` actually occurs. Both mutations fail it now.

## Measured

`bench/results/2026-08-07-get-scaling.edn`, corpus grown 64x (1,000 → 64,000):

| shard count | index blocks | mean GETs/query | waves |
|---|---|---|---|
| **fixed at 8** | 39,310 → 59,990 | **77.4 → 76.0 (0.98x)** | 9 → 11 |
| **grown 1 → 32** | 7,268 → 175,116 | **19.8 → 240.8 (12.2x)** | 8 → 15 |

Per-shard cost is flat in corpus size. All of the growth is fan-out — every
shard is asked every query. So shard count should follow write parallelism and
object size, not corpus size; and client-side fan-out, not index size, is what
bounds this design.

## The routing dictionary — `route.cljc`

The fan-out above is what put the honest reach at 10⁹–10¹⁰ pages. One
dictionary for the whole index removes most of it
(`bench/results/2026-08-08-route-scaling.edn`, ADR-2608085000):

    term -> [{:shard :max-impact :df :postings} ...]

Locating a term costs one descent instead of one per shard, and a shard whose
per-term maxima cannot reach the k-th score is skipped without being opened.
Same corpus, same queries, both read paths on one index:

| corpus | docs / shards | v1 GETs | route GETs | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| uniform | 64,000 / 32 | 240.8 | **77.6** | fan-out growth 12.2x → **3.9x** |
| uniform | 16,000 / 8 | 72.8 | **39.2** | descent only — nothing was pruned |
| clustered | 64,000 / 32 | 150.6 | **20.4** | 30.8 of 32 shards never became candidates |

Two mechanisms, and the stats report both because a corpus picks between them:
`total → considered` drops shards that hold no query term (free — the routing
entry does not list them), `considered → opened` drops shards whose bound
cannot win (pruning). A topical corpus collapses at the first step, a uniform
one at the second.

`:shard-batch` is the GETs-versus-waves dial. Opening one shard per wave is
GET-optimal and depth-pessimal — 70.6 GETs in 70 waves at 64k/32, against 77.6
in 18 at the default of 8. Answers are identical at every setting, which the
suite checks.

Index cost: blocks ×1.00–1.02, bytes ×1.18–1.32.

## Run

```bash
npm install --no-save nbb@1.4.208

# tests (25 assertions, including the exactness oracle)
npx nbb --classpath src \
  test/run_tests.cljs

# GET-scaling receipt -> bench/results/
npx nbb --classpath src \
  bench/get_scaling.cljs
```

## Use

```clojure
(require '[kotobase-shard-index.build :as build]
         '[kotobase-shard-index.query :as query]
         '[kotobase-shard-index.node :as node])

;; build side -- runs where the crawler runs
(def store (node/fs-store "/tmp/index"))          ; or a bucket
(def m (build/build! store node/sha256-hex docs {:shard-count 16}))

;; read side -- runs in the client, touches nothing but the store
(query/search store (:manifest-cid m) "検索 エンジン" {:k 10})
```

## Where the pieces live

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/…/build.cljc` | corpus → blocks + manifest. Content-defined block boundaries |
| `src/…/append.cljc` | one more segment, without rebuilding. Scoring basis and drift |
| `src/…/query.cljc` | v1 read path: descend every shard's dictionary |
| `src/…/route.cljc` | routing read path: one descent, then open shards best-first |
| `src/…/block.cljc` | the object-store shape (`-get`, `-get-range`) and the GET counter |
| `test/run_tests.cljs` | the exactness oracle and everything else |
| `test/mutations.cljs` | checks that the suite can actually fail |
| `bench/check_budget.cljs` | the GET budget the fleet gate enforces |

CI is the murakumo fleet gate `root-shard-index` in `com-junkawasaki/root`
(`scripts/fleet-ci/gates/shard-index-check.cljs`), not GitHub Actions
(ADR-2607300900). It runs `test/run_tests.cljs` and `bench/check_budget.cljs`
against a checked-out tree and believes neither one's exit code alone.

## Appending without rebuilding — `append.cljc`

`build!` reads the whole corpus, which is fine for a benchmark and useless for
a crawl. `append!` adds one segment: existing shards' blocks are neither read
for their contents nor rewritten, and what is written is the new segment, the
routing dictionary and one manifest (ADR-2608086000).

Two things make it work, and both are visible in the manifest:

**The scoring basis.** Impacts are baked and BM25's idf is a function of the
whole corpus, so an impact is comparable to another impact only if both were
computed against the same N and avgdl. `:scoring-basis` records them, and an
append scores its new segment against the RECORDED values — so the index stays
internally consistent by construction. The price is drift against what a full
rebuild would compute, which `drift-report` and the bench measure rather than
assume.

**Content-defined block boundaries.** Where a dictionary block ends is decided
by hashing the key at that position, not by a running count. With fixed arity,
inserting one term shifts every following leaf, so an append rewrites the
dictionary from the insertion point onward — the cost is set by the vocabulary
rather than the batch. Same idea as `kotoba-lang/prolly-tree`, reimplemented
in fifteen lines to keep this subsystem dependency-free.

What `append!` does NOT do is detect that someone else already appended to the
same parent manifest — the parent has no record of its children, so that
evidence lives in the ref, not the block. It is `inga`'s to decide. What is
guaranteed is that `append!` is a pure function of `(manifest, docs)`: the same
append twice gives the same manifest CID, so a retry is free.

## Compacting — `compact.cljc`

`append!` adds a shard per batch, and every shard holding a query term is a
shard the client opens. Appending without compacting trades a rebuild for a
read path that degrades on every batch.

Compaction merges adjacent shards. Because every shard was scored against the
same recorded basis, merging is a concatenation plus a re-sort — **not a
rescore** — so **the answer does not change**, score for score. The suite
checks that against the index as it was before the merge, and the bench checks
it again at corpus scale.

That is why compaction and rebuilding are separate operations:

| | fixes | changes answers? |
|---|---|---|
| `compact!` | fan-out (shard count) | **no** |
| `build!` (rebuild) | drift (stale scoring basis) | yes — measured 0.64 top-10 overlap at basis ×2.92 |

Only adjacent shards merge: doc-ids are contiguous and metadata resolves by
arithmetic on `:doc-base`, so a non-adjacent merge would leave a hole. Since
appends always add at the end, adjacent is what a crawl accumulates anyway.
`plan` suggests a window (most shards removed for the fewest documents
rewritten); `compact!` takes explicit ids so a caller with its own policy is
not fighting it.

## Measured on a real corpus

Every number above this point came from `synth/corpus` — a Zipf draw over
`w<rank>` tokens. That left the CJK half of `analyze/tokenize` **never
benchmarked at all**, even though the deployed `web.search` this format matches
is mostly Japanese. `bench/real_corpus.cljs` reads this workspace's own ADRs
and repo READMEs instead: 5,775 documents of mixed Japanese and English, real
vocabulary 127,042 against the synthetic 20,000.

    npx nbb --classpath src:bench \
      bench/incremental.cljs

It is not a web crawl — small, technical, and biased toward this workspace's
own vocabulary. What it is not is generated by the assumptions the index was
designed under, which is the failure a synthetic benchmark cannot detect.

## Known gaps

- **Content address is not a CIDv1.** `b` + sha-256 hex, not multiformats.
  `kotoba-lang/io-multiformats` exists and adopting it is follow-up work.
- **Range GET is implemented but unused by the query path.** Blocks are fetched
  whole. Sub-block ranges cut bytes, not round trips, and round trips are what
  the design is bounded by — so this is deliberate ordering, not an oversight.
- **No `IPatternSource` adapter, on purpose.** Posting lists are bytes and
  belong on the block plane, not the datom plane (ADR-2608039970). The
  `datom-source` seam is the right home for the manifest/metadata plane, which
  this subsystem does not yet expose.
- **Single-writer publish is assumed, not enforced.** There is no ref plane
  here at all; `build!` returns a manifest CID and says nothing about how it is
  published. That is the `inga` quorum boundary and is out of scope.
- **No incremental build.** `build!` rebuilds from the whole corpus. Segment
  merge (add a shard's new segment, rewrite only the manifest) is the next
  thing to write.
- **Fan-out ceiling.** Every shard is asked every query, so client-side fan-out
  is the real scale limit — practical to ~10² shards, which is why the honest
  ceiling of this design is 10⁹–10¹⁰ documents rather than 10¹¹.
