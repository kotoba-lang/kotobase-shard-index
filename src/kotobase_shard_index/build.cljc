  "Build side: a corpus becomes immutable blocks plus one manifest.

  Everything here runs where the crawler runs, never where a query runs. The
  output is a set of objects that no longer change, so the read side needs no
  server, no lock, and no invalidation — a block that differs is a different
  address.

  Two decisions are load-bearing and both are visible in the block formats:

  1. **Impacts are precomputed and stored, not scored at query time.** BM25
     needs df, N and avgdl; a client that scored at query time would need the
     global statistics AND the term frequency of every candidate. Storing the
     finished contribution means a posting entry is `[doc-id impact]` and
     nothing else has to travel.

  2. **idf is global, not per shard.** Shards are built in one pass so df is
     counted across the whole corpus. Per-shard idf would make two shards
     disagree about what a rare word is, and the cross-shard merge would be
     comparing numbers that do not mean the same thing.

  Every value written into a block is an integer, a string or a keyword.
  Floating point is excluded on purpose: `pr-str` of an integer-valued double
  is \"10.0\" on the JVM and \"10\" in JavaScript, which would give the same
  logical block two different addresses on two runtimes."

;; Where a block ends is decided by the CONTENT at that point, not by a

;; `partition-all fanout`, inserting one term shifts every following leaf's
;; contents by one position, so a one-document append rewrote 3,863 blocks of
;; a 490,130-block index — nearly the whole dictionary, to add one document.
;; Measured on the real corpus, `bench/results/2026-08-08-incremental-*`.
;;
;; With a content-defined boundary, a term inserted between two boundaries
;; changes exactly one leaf and the path above it. Same idea as
;; `kotoba-lang/prolly-tree` and as every Merkle-structured store in this
