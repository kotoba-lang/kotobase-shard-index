  "The S3 shape, and the instrument that measures it.

  An object store gives you exactly two things: fetch an immutable object by
  name, and fetch a byte range of one. Both cost one round trip. Everything
  this subsystem claims about scale reduces to HOW MANY of those a query
  issues, so the store protocol and the counter that wraps it live together.

  We count GETs, not milliseconds. `kotobase-peer`'s dag-shape bench
  (ADR-2608021000) established that discipline for exactly this reason: wall
  clock on a shared workstation measures the workstation. A GET count is a
  property of the design."
