  "Canonical bytes for content addressing.

  A block's identity is the hash of its bytes, so two writers that mean the
  same block must produce the same bytes. Clojure switches map implementation
  above 8 entries and stops preserving insertion order (measured in this
  workspace on `css.core/declarations`, CLAUDE.md), so `pr-str` over a literal
  map is NOT deterministic at block sizes we actually use. `canonical` sorts
  every map before printing.

  The hash itself is INJECTED, never embedded — this namespace stays portable
  and the Node adapter supplies sha-256 (`kotobase-shard-index.node`). Same
  port-not-embed convention `kotoba.map.data` uses."

  `kotobase.blocks/verify-block` checks. Header `01 55 12 20`.

  This used to be `(str \"b\" hex)`, this subsystem's own form, with adopting
  multiformats recorded as a named follow-up (ADR-2608071500). The follow-up
  is what this is: the digest was always sha-256 of the canonical bytes, so
  the change is a re-encoding of an address that was already the right
  number — and it is what lets these blocks BE ordinary blocks in the
  storage plane rather than a private namespace beside it.

  It is a **format change**: every address moves, so an index built before
  this must be rebuilt rather than read. Nothing published had been."
