  "Adding documents without rebuilding the index.

  `build/build!` reads the whole corpus. That is fine for a benchmark and
  useless for a crawl: the point of a crawl is that it never finishes, and an
  index that can only be produced from all of the documents at once cannot
  follow one. Both ADR-2608071500 and ADR-2608085000 name this as the next
  thing to write, ahead of any further tuning of the read path.

  ## What an append actually costs

  Blocks are content-addressed, so re-putting an unchanged block is a no-op at
  the same address. The cost of an append is therefore exactly the blocks that
  DIFFER, and there are only three kinds:

  1. the new segment's own postings, dictionary and metadata;
  2. the routing dictionary — its leaves change only where a new term or a new
     (term, shard) pair lands, and internal nodes only along those paths;
  3. one manifest.

  Nothing belonging to an existing shard is rewritten. `bench/incremental.cljs`
  measures the ratio against a full rebuild rather than asserting it.

  ## The part that is not free: the scoring basis

  Impacts are precomputed (ADR-2608071500 D-alternatives: scoring at query time
  would mean shipping global statistics and every candidate's term frequency).
  BM25's idf is a function of the whole corpus, so **an impact is comparable to
  another impact only if both were computed against the same N and avgdl**.

  An append cannot recompute the existing shards' impacts without rewriting
  them, which is the thing it exists to avoid. So it scores the new segment
  against the basis recorded in the manifest — `:scoring-basis` — and the
  index stays internally consistent by construction.

  What that costs is accuracy against a hypothetical full rebuild, and the
  honest name for it is drift: as the corpus grows past the basis, idf values
  computed from the basis are increasingly wrong for everyone. The design
  decision is to make the basis **explicit and measured**, not to pretend the
  problem is absent:

  - `:generation` counts appends since the last full build.
  - `drift-report` says how far the corpus has moved from its basis.
  - `bench/incremental.cljs` measures the top-k disagreement against a full
    rebuild of the same documents, which is the number that decides when a
    rebuild is due.

  The alternative — rescoring on every append so the answer always matches a
  full rebuild — is a full rebuild.

  ## Doc ids, and what this namespace does NOT solve

  Ids continue from the manifest's document count, so they stay contiguous and
  a metadata lookup still resolves shard and offset by arithmetic.

  That makes appends ordered: two appends against the same parent manifest
  both start at the same id, so they produce two segments claiming the same
  range. **Neither resulting manifest is corrupt** — each is a complete,
  internally consistent index — but they have diverged, and only one of them
  can be the next published state.

  There is deliberately no check for this here. The parent manifest cannot
  know that someone else has already appended to it; detecting that is exactly
  what a conditional ref is for, and the ref plane is `inga`'s, out of scope
  for this subsystem (ADR-2608071500: \"publish の単一 writer は前提であって
  強制ではない\"). A guard here would be theatre — it would pass while the two
  writers raced, because the evidence it needs is in the ref, not the block.

  What IS guaranteed, and what the suite checks, is that `append!` is a pure
  function of `(manifest, docs)`: the same append performed twice produces the
  same manifest CID. A retry after a lost response is therefore free, and a
  duplicate append is detectable by comparing addresses."
