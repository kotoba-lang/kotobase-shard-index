  "How many object-store GETs does one query cost, as the corpus grows?

    npx nbb --classpath src \\
      bench/get_scaling.cljs [out.edn]

  This is the number the design rests on. A client with no server pays one
  round trip per GET, so GETs-per-query IS the cost model.

  ## Two regimes, because sharding is not free

  The per-shard cost is logarithmic: descend a dictionary tree, read the top
  chunks of impact-ordered postings, stop when the bound separates. But EVERY
  shard is asked EVERY query, so the client pays a fan-out term linear in the
  shard count. Those pull in opposite directions and reporting only one of
  them would be a sales pitch.

  - `:fixed-shards`  — shard count constant while the corpus grows 64x. This
                       isolates the per-shard cost, which is the design claim.
  - `:scaled-shards` — shard count grows with the corpus (n/2000). This is the
                       fan-out term, which is the design's real ceiling.

  We count GETs, not milliseconds, deliberately — the discipline
  `kotobase-peer`'s dag-shape bench established (ADR-2608021000): wall clock on
  a machine running many agent sessions measures the machine.

  `waves` is the second number and the one latency tracks: the depth of the
  sequential dependency chain. GETs within a wave are independent and a real
  client issues them concurrently.

  What this does NOT measure: real network latency, object-store tail
  behaviour, concurrency, or CDN hit rates. The store is in-memory. Multiply
  waves by a measured per-GET RTT for a latency estimate — do not read one off
  this file."
