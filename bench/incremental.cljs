  "Two questions an append has to answer, on a real corpus.

    npx nbb --classpath src:bench \\
      bench/incremental.cljs [out.edn]

  **1. What does an append cost?** Blocks are content-addressed, so re-putting
  an unchanged block lands on the same key. The real cost of an append is the
  count of blocks that DIFFER, measured against rebuilding the same corpus
  from scratch. If that ratio is not small the append is a rebuild wearing a
  different name.

  **2. What does it cost in answers?** Impacts are baked against a scoring
  basis (`build!`'s `:scoring-basis`), and an append scores its new segment
  against the RECORDED basis so its numbers stay on the same scale as the
  existing shards'. The price is that both drift away from what a full rebuild
  of the combined corpus would compute. That drift is the number that decides
  when a rebuild is due, so it is measured against a full rebuild of exactly
  the same documents rather than argued about.

  Run on the real corpus (`real_corpus.cljs`) rather than the synthetic one.
  The synthetic corpus is uniform by construction, so every append would look
  statistically identical to the corpus it joins — which is precisely the
  condition under which drift is smallest and the measurement is flattering."
